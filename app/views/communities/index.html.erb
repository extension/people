  <h2>People Communities are now managed in Google Groups</h2>

<h3>Communities created in People had the option of being connected to Google Groups to function as a listserv. These groups were managed via the People interface.</h3>

<p>People is being decommissioned this summer and we are starting the process by removing the People interface "wrapper" and allowing all communities (groups) to be directly managed with Google Groups. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTNZX2Z0zaEUEK7GF_RvEV882R3D9cjo7sUIGAiAXsAQN3YAAutz0NomgjA1Vk1z5gPDv81CaP0rv8G/pub">Additional information is available here</a>.</p>
