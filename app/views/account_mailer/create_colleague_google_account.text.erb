Hi <%= @recipient.first_name %>,

<%- if !@bycolleague.is_system_account? -%>

Your colleague has created an eXtension Google Account for you.

The colleague that performed this action is:

 <%= @bycolleague.fullname %>
 <%= @bycolleague.email %>
 <%= person_url(@bycolleague) %>

<%- else -%>
An eXtension Google Account was created for you by an automated process within the People application.

The most likely reason that this account was created was that you were added to a People community that has a Google Group associated with it that is used to share Google resources such as Google documents or Google Calendar invitations.
<%- end -%>

There's one more step you'll need to take.

Because of the way we protect your password in our database, we couldn't synchronize your People password to Google when the account was created.

The Google password has been set to a random value.

In order to do that password synchronization, you have two options

 1. You can set a new password for your account.  ( <%= password_person_url(@recipient) -%> )
 2. If you are signed into the People website, you can sign out of the People website and sign back in again.
    If you are already signed out, just sign in, we'll set your Google password then.

Either option will set the password for your eXtension Google Account.
