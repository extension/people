Hi <%= @recipient.email -%>,

eXtensionIDâ€™s are currently limited to individuals closely associated with the U.S. Cooperative Extension system (either those working at a Land-Grant Institution, State college or U.S. Government personnel affiliated with Cooperative Extension), or individuals in Extension-related organizations working on projects with Cooperative Extension staff.

In order to verify your account, you must be invited by a colleague that currently has an eXtension Account.

Just forward the information below to your colleague, the link within the email will allow your colleague to easily sign-in and invite you to get an eXtensionID.

Dear Colleague,

I'd like to be a part of the National eXtension Directory at https://people.extension.org which provides access to various extension.org tools and platforms, including the eXtension Ask an Expert.

In order to do so, my email address must be invited to join eXtension.

Just click this URL:

<%= invite_people_token_url(token: @recipient.token) %>

which will send me an email to start the signup process at eXtension.
