Hi <%= @recipient.first_name %>,

You are receiving this email because you are connected as a <%= @recipient_connection -%>
to the <%= @community.name %> community at https://people.extension.org

Your community has a Google Group associated with the community.  eXtension uses
Google Groups to provide mailing list-like services to our communities, and we
are in the process of taking steps to improve how these Google Groups are provisioned
and managed.

As part of that process, your Google Group has a new email address.  The new
email address to send email to this Google Group is:

<%= @google_group.group_email_address -%>

The old address for the group <%= @google_group.old_group_email_address -%> will still
work! But we would strongly encourage you to start using the new email address.

<%- if !@google_group.lists_alias.blank? -%>
If you are still using the legacy email address for this Google Group:

<%= @google_group.lists_alias -%>@lists.extension.org - please start using the new
email address.  Beginning April 2, 2018, <%= @google_group.lists_alias -%>@lists.extension.org
will no longer be forwarded to your google group.

<%- end -%>
If you have any questions or concerns - do not hesistate to contact me by emailing
our Google/People support address at:

contact-us@extension.org
