Hello Group Members!

You are receiving this automated email because you are part of the Google Group for the <%= @community.name %> community at <%= community_url(@community) %>

eXtension uses Google Groups to provide mailing list services to our communities, and we are taking steps to improve how these Google Groups are provisioned and managed.

Your Google Group has a new email address. The new email address to send email to this Google Group is:

<%= @google_group.group_email_address %>

Please start using this new email address.

Beginning April 11, 2018, the old address for the group: <%= @google_group.old_group_email_address -%> will no longer forward to the Google Group.

If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to contact me by email at:

<%= Settings.support_email_address -%>
