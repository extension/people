        <h3>Am I eligible for an eXtensionID?</h3>
        <p>eXtensionID’s are currently limited to individuals closely associated with the U.S. Cooperative Extension system (either those working at a Land-Grant Institution, State college or U.S. Government personnel affiliated with Cooperative Extension), or individuals in Extension-related organizations working on projects with Cooperative Extension staff.</p>

        <p>If you’re not a part of any of the groups listed above, we invite you to still take advantage of eXtension’s great educational and informational resources and programs.  Just visit <a href="http://www.extension.org">www.extension.org</a>. You’ll have full access to the “best of the best” of the Cooperative Extension System’s vast resources.</p>

        <p>If you came to this site from our Online Learning Events website at <a href="https://learn.extension.org">https://learn.extension.org</a>,
          please note that you do not need an eXtension account to participate in the learning opportunities listed by eXtension partners at that website</p>
        <p>
          Continuing to sign up for your eXtensionID indicates that you read and accept the
          <a href="https://extension.org/terms-of-use/" target="_blank">eXtension Terms of Use</a>
        </p>
