  <p class="lead">Experiments are just that: experimental views, methods, and ways of exploring the data in data.extension.org.
    These might be specific questions that we've been asked, or asked ourselves, and we'd like to keep up and available as the data changes week-by-week.
    Some of these will "graduate" to more official views in the application, some will disappear without warning. If you find one of them useful, let us know!
